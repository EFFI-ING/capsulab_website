California Civil Code §1542 says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” \n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t10.\tINDEMNIFICATION\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\tYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Capsulab and Capsulab Affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to your breach of this Agreement, your use of Capsulab Materials other than as expressly authorized in this Agreement, or your use of any information obtained from the Website.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.\tMISCELLANEOUS\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.1.\tEntire Agreement.<br> This Agreement  represents the entire agreement between you and Capsulab with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior and contemporaneous oral and/or written agreements, understandings and statements between you and Capsulab with respect to such subject matter. You acknowledge and agree that in entering into this Agreement you have not relied on any statement or representation (whether negligently or innocently made) not expressly set out in this Agreement, such as statements and explanations in any FAQs, summaries or explanatory guides regarding this Agreement, or other marketing material on the Website.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.2.\tGoverning Law.<br> This Agreement (including without limitation its validity) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Israel without regard to any conflicts of laws rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement and is hereby disclaimed.  You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Tel Aviv-Jaffa and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts, provided that Capsulab may seek equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE THIS AGREEMENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, YOU AGREE THAT SUCH CLAIM SHALL BE DEEMED PERMANENTLY BARRED. Any claims or damages that you may incur hereunder shall only be enforceable against Capsulab, and not any other entity (such as Capsulab Affiliates) or Capsulab's officers, directors, representatives, employees, or agents. Moreover, if you are entering into this Agreement as a consumer (as defined in the Law of your jurisdiction), this Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, exclude or limit any mandatory rights you may have under the consumer protection Laws of your jurisdiction. You agree that you may bring claims against Capsulab only in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action or capacity.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.3.\tLanguage; Electronic Contract and Communications.<br> The language of this Agreement is expressly agreed to be the English language.

We may be able (but are not obligated) to provide you with copies of this Agreement on written request; however, please be sure to print a copy of this Agreement for your own records. When you visit or submit information on the Website or send an email to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically. Although we may choose to provide you notice under this Agreement by postal mail, we may also choose to provide notice by email (in which case the notice will be deemed given on the day after sending) and/or by posting notices on the Website (in which case the notice will be deemed given when you access the Website). In addition, you acknowledge and agree that when you click on any “SUBMIT”, “I AGREE”, “I ACCEPT”, or similar button, through which you submit information, you are submitting a legally binding electronic signature. Pursuant to any applicable Laws, including without limitation the United States Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, P.L. 106-229 (the \"E-Sign Act\") or other similar statutes, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, ORDERS AND OTHER RECORDS AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR COMPLETED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES OFFERED BY CAPSULAB.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.4.\tEmail, Telephone and SMS Communication.<br> By providing your email address, fax number, or phone number on the Website, you authorize us to contact you by telephone, fax and email. Such communication shall be in connection with: (a) an issue regarding our Website, (b) in response to inquiries (such as quotes) you have requested from us; and/or (c) to provide information or offers that may be of interest to you. Moreover, you agree that such communications may be sent to your mobile phone via automated telephone dialing system, prerecorded calls, text messages, SMS, MMS, and picture messages, even if the phone number you provide is on a corporate, state or national Do Not Call list. If you do not want to receive such emails, telephone calls, or text messages, you may opt out (i) during the registration process, or (ii) by emailing the address at the bottom of the emails with “UNSUBSCRIBE” or by texting “STOP” or “OPT-OUT” as specifically set forth in the communication. For more information, please see our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.5.\tAssignment.<br> Capsulab may assign this Agreement (or any of its rights and/or obligations hereunder) without your consent, and without notice or obligation to you. This Agreement is personal to you, and you may not assign (or in any other way transfer) this Agreement (or any of its obligations or rights hereunder) without Capsulab’s express prior written consent. Any prohibited assignment shall be null and void.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.6.\tFeedback.<br> If you send us any suggestions, feedback, or similar ideas for or about any Capsulab Materials (collectively, \"Feedback\"), you agree that: (a) Capsulab exclusively owns (and is hereby assigned) all right, title, and interest (including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights) in and to the Feedback, and you are not owed any compensation (or other obligation) in exchange; (b) the Feedback does not contain confidential or proprietary information belonging to you or any third party; (c) Capsulab may (itself and/or via third parties), in perpetuity, use, copy, distribute, sell, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially exploit the Feedback for any purpose and in any way, and without any restriction or obligations of any kind whatsoever; (d) there is no obligation for us to review your Feedback; and (e) Capsulab has no obligation to keep the Feedback confidential.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.7.\tSeverability.<br> If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, then: (a) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) the Parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace the provision with a provision that is legal, valid and enforceable and that most closely approximates the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified in respect of such jurisdiction. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it as aforesaid, then such provision will be ineffective solely as to such jurisdiction, and will be substituted (in respect of such jurisdiction) with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.8.\tRemedies.<br> Except as may be expressly stated otherwise in this Agreement, no right or remedy conferred upon or reserved by any party under this Agreement is intended to be, or shall be deemed, exclusive of any other right or remedy under this Agreement, at law or in equity, but shall be cumulative of such other rights and remedies.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.9.\tPrivacy.<br> We collect certain data and information about you in connection with your access and use of the Capsulab Materials. We will use, store and otherwise process such data and information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated into, and made a part of, this Agreement by reference.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.10.\tWaiver.<br> No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any waiver granted hereunder must be in writing (for waivers by you, emails will be acceptable; for waivers by Capsulab, the writing must be duly signed by an authorized representative of Capsulab), and shall be valid only in the specific instance in which given.\n\t\t<br><br>\n\t\t11.11.\tRelationship.<br> The relationship of the parties is solely that of independent contractors.
